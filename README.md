## üöÄ Live Demo

Visit the live application at: [BMI Calculator](https://bmi-calculator.onrender.com)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.15.0
- Flask 2.0.1
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oblivious19/Bmi-Calculator.git
   cd Bmi-Calculator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the model file:

   Due to file size limitations, the model file is not included in the repository. You can download it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Qv7ipbhfAer0XxfnBxPc2vUNedEbJhj/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the root directory of the project with the name `custom_cnn_bmi_model_final.keras`.

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## üíª Usage

1. Upload a full-body photo using the drag & drop interface or click to select a file
2. Wait for the AI to process the image and predict height and weight
3. View your predicted BMI and health category
4. Check the detailed metrics and explanations

## üîß Technical Details

### Model Architecture

The application uses a custom CNN model trained to predict height and weight from full-body images. The model processes images with the following steps:

1. Image preprocessing (resize to 224x224, normalization)
2. Feature extraction through convolutional layers
3. Prediction of height and weight values
4. Post-processing to validate and adjust predictions to realistic ranges

### Height Validation

The application includes sophisticated height validation to ensure predictions are within realistic human ranges:

- Minimum height: 1.4m (140cm)
- Maximum height: 2.1m (210cm)
- Automatic conversion from centimeters to meters
- Scaling of unrealistic predictions using multiple factors

### BMI Categories

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 ‚â§ BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 ‚â§ BMI < 30
- Obese: BMI ‚â• 30

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on Render:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new Web Service on Render
3. Connect your forked repository
4. Use the following settings:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn app:app`
   - Environment: Python 3.9
